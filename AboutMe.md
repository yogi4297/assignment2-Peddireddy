# YogaNarasimhaReddy Peddireddy

I am YogaNarasimhaReddy from Kurnool born on 04-FEB-1997. Completed my Undergraduation at Manipal University in Civil Engineering. After my UG I joined OSI Digital as an Oracle Ebs Technical Consultant and worked for 2.5 year. Working at OSI gave me good knowledge in SQL, PL/SQL, Interfaces, API's, Oracle Forms and Reports. I had to quit working at OSI in 2021 to pursue my Masters in Applied Computer Science at NorthWest Missouri State University.
